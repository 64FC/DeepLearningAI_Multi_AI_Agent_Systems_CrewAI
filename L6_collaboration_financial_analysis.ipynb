      "After analyzing the latest market data for AAPL, here are potential trading strategies that align with the user's risk tolerance:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Long-Term Investment Strategy: Considering AAPL's consistent growth over the past 5 years and strong financial indicators such as a high Return on Equity and Profit Margin, a long-term investment strategy could be suitable for investors with a moderate to high risk tolerance. This strategy involves buying and holding AAPL stock for an extended period to benefit from the company's growth potential and market performance.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Option Trading Strategy: For investors with a higher risk tolerance and a preference for active trading, an option trading strategy could be considered. Options provide leverage and flexibility for traders to capitalize on short-term market movements. Given AAPL's historical volatility and market cap, options trading could offer opportunities for quick profits or hedging against potential downside risks.\n",
